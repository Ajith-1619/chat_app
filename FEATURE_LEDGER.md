- Change: Added post-send channel action extraction helper for task-like channel messages.
- Verification: PHP syntax checks passed for changed backend files. Dart format passed. Flutter/Dart analyze timed out in this workspace.

## 2026-07-22 16:13:54 - External Group/Channel Create API
- Requirement: External apps/portals must create Flow groups and channels without browser login session cookies.
- Change: Added API-key protected endpoint server_patch/chat/external_create_conversation.php for type=group/channel creation.
- Change: Added docs/external_conversation_create_api.md with Postman-ready request examples.
- Security: Supports Authorization Bearer, X-Skylink-Conversation-Key, X-Skylink-API-Key, and server-side key override via environment/config.

- Verification: PHP syntax check passed for external_create_reminder.php.

## 2026-07-22 16:46:39 - Channel Right Panel Metadata Visibility
- Requirement: Show channel description, editable details, Next Action, Next Action Persons, and Next Action Date in the right-side panel.
- Root Cause: Some channel/group records arrive in the UI as group previews, so channel-only checks hid metadata and edit controls even when channel profile data existed.
- Change: Updated lib/home/home_screen.dart to load channel profile metadata for group rooms and show channel detail cards whenever channel metadata is returned.
- Change: Added a local right-panel date picker helper and corrected rename dialog scoping after the visibility update.
- Verification: dart format passed. flutter analyze lib/home/home_screen.dart reports no errors; remaining items are existing warnings/infos.
- Build: Not run in this task.

## 2026-07-22 17:13:10 - Channel Right Panel Top Summary Visibility
- Requirement: Right-side panel must immediately show channel Description, Next Action, Next Action Person, and Next Action Date, with edit controls visible in the channel tools area.
- Root Cause: Channel metadata cards were placed below management/member details, so they were not visible in the first right-panel viewport.
- Change: Moved the important channel metadata summary directly below Search/Media in lib/home/home_screen.dart while keeping detailed cards lower in the panel.
- Verification: dart format passed. flutter analyze lib/home/home_screen.dart produced no errors; only existing warnings/infos remain.
- Build: flutter build web --release succeeded. Output: build/web.

## 2026-07-22 17:47:37 - Channel Next Action Detection, Description Profile, Selection Stability
- Requirement: Channel messages like @Ajith_P complete the Chat application task on tomorrow must update Next Action, Next Action Person, and Next Action Date.
- Requirement: Saved channel description must appear in the right-side panel after reload/save.
- Requirement: Selecting message text must not scroll/jump the chat window.
- Change: Relaxed channel detection in server_patch/chat/channel_action_helper.php to support channel-* JIDs and channel-kind records, not only group_type=channel.
- Change: Improved @mention matching for names like Ajith P / Ajith Kumar P using normalized name variants.
- Change: Relaxed channel profile/update endpoints to support channel-* JID records so description and metadata load consistently.
- Change: Removed forced scroll-anchor restore during browser text selection in lib/chat/chat_screen.dart.
- Verification: PHP syntax checks passed for channel_action_helper.php, channel_profile.php, update_channel.php, send_message.php. Flutter analyze on edited Dart files returned no errors, only existing warnings/infos.
- Build: flutter build web --release succeeded. Output: build/web.

## 2026-07-23 11:06:49 - Channel Metadata Runtime Fix And Web Build
- Requirement: Right-side panel must show saved channel description and automatically detected Next Action / Person / Date for messages such as @Ajith_P complete the chat application on tomorrow.
- Root Cause: Channel metadata update relied on strict channel classification and ran after fastcgi response, so channel-* room records could remain empty when the panel refreshed.
- Change: send_message.php now updates channel next-action metadata before returning the message response.
- Change: channel_action_helper.php recognizes channel-* JIDs and normalizes mention variants like Ajith_P / Ajith P / Ajith Kumar P.
- Change: channel_profile.php and update_channel.php accept channel-* room records for profile/update, and chat_api.dart adds a cache buster for profile reloads.
- Change: chat_screen.dart no longer forces scroll-anchor jump during browser text selection.
- Verification: PHP syntax checks passed for changed backend files. Flutter analyze on edited Dart files returned no errors, only existing warnings/infos.
- Build: flutter build web --release succeeded. Output: build/web.

## 2026-07-23 11:44:25 - Web Message Text Selection Stability
- Requirement: Selecting partial message text in web must not scroll/jump the chat window, while native selection and Ctrl+C copy continue to work.
- Root Cause: Flutter web text selection can trigger parent scrollable ensure-visible behavior while the chat list is still scrollable and auto-scroll timers can run.
- Change: Added a pointer-down selection intent lock before selection starts and temporarily applies NeverScrollableScrollPhysics to the chat message list while selection is active.
- Change: Existing native SelectableText and browser copy behavior are preserved.
- Verification: dart format passed. flutter analyze lib/chat/chat_screen.dart returned no errors, only existing warnings/infos.
- Build: flutter build web --release succeeded. Output: build/web.

## 2026-07-23 13:15:16 +05:30 - Web Message Selection Scroll Regression Fix
- Requirement: Message text selection and copy must continue to work, but normal chat scrolling must not be blocked and selected messages must not jump to the bottom.
- Root Cause: The earlier fix used selection state to disable the message list scroll physics. Pointer down on selectable message text therefore turned normal scrolling off.
- Change: Kept ScrollablePositionedList on normal ClampingScrollPhysics, separated text-selection state from list scroll physics, and retained selection state only to guard automatic bottom jumps.
- Verification: dart format lib/chat/chat_screen.dart passed; lutter analyze lib/chat/chat_screen.dart reported no errors, only existing warnings; lutter build web --release --base-href /chat/ completed successfully.

## 2026-07-23 15:43:48 +05:30 - Message Text Selection Gesture Stabilization
- Requirement: Message text must be easy to select on the first attempt, without screen dancing, unwanted bubble menus, swipe actions, or bottom jumps.
- Root Cause: Selectable text gestures were competing with parent message bubble long-press/right-click/swipe handlers during the first selection attempt.
- Change: Added a short text-selection intent window, suppresses floating message menu while text selection is active, keeps list scrolling enabled, and prevents swipe gestures from interfering with active browser text selection.
- Verification: dart format lib/chat/chat_screen.dart passed; lutter analyze lib/chat/chat_screen.dart reported no errors, only existing warnings; lutter build web --release --base-href /chat/ completed successfully.

## 2026-07-23 16:15:23 +05:30 - Chat Context Preservation Rule
- Requirement: When users interact with existing chat content, Flow must preserve their context and must not automatically move the conversation.
- Covered Interactions: Text selection/copy, manual reading/scrolling older messages, opening image/file previews, and media/content viewing flows.
- Change: Added a central _shouldPreserveUserContext guard in ChatScreen, marks context during user scrolls, text selection, and attachment preview opens, and blocks non-forced auto-scroll while the guard is active or the user is away from latest messages. Explicit jump-to-latest still clears the guard and moves to the bottom.
- Verification: dart format passed for changed files; lutter analyze lib/chat/chat_screen.dart lib/attachments/attachment_widgets.dart reported no errors, only existing warnings; lutter build web --release --base-href /chat/ completed successfully.

## 2026-07-23 17:30:34 +05:30 - Channel Hashtag Support
- Requirement: Add channel-only #tag concept so channel messages can be categorized and found later.
- Feature: Channel messages now persist detected hashtags, expose top channel tags in channel profile data, show a Tags card in the right-side channel panel, and make #tags in message text tappable to open in-chat search.
- Change impact: Limited to channel send/profile endpoints and Flutter chat/right-panel rendering. Direct chats and normal groups do not persist channel tags.
- Regression verification: PHP lint passed for server_patch/chat/bootstrap.php, send_message.php, channel_profile.php. Targeted Flutter analyze showed no new errors. Web release build passed at build/web.

## 2026-07-23 17:49:44 +05:30 - Message Right Click Menu Restore
- Requirement: Restore message right-click floating menu after text-selection stability changes.
- Feature: Right-click on a chat message now opens the Flow floating message action menu even when selectable text pointer locks are active.
- Change impact: Limited to message bubble secondary-click handling in lib/chat/chat_screen.dart. Long-press text-selection guard remains unchanged.
- Regression verification: dart format passed. Targeted flutter analyze completed with no new errors; existing warnings remain.

## 2026-07-24 10:37:38 +05:30 - Chat Text Selection Mode Root Fix
- Requirement: Permanently stop chat jumping/flickering while selecting message text.
- Root cause: History refresh/polling and scroll-position listeners could call setState and replace the message list while browser text selection handles were active; scroll-to-bottom logic then fought the active viewport.
- Change: Added explicit Selection Mode in lib/chat/chat_screen.dart. Selection Mode captures bottom state and visible anchor, queues history refresh results, blocks message-list rebuilds/scroll listener UI changes/presence/location UI updates during selection, and merges queued history only after selection ends.
- Merge behavior: If the user was at bottom before selection, queued messages merge and the chat returns to bottom. If reading older content, queued messages merge while restoring the captured visible message anchor.
- Verification: dart format passed; targeted flutter analyze completed with no new errors; web release build passed at build/web.

## 2026-07-24 11:04:49 +05:30 - External API Planning Documentation
- Requirement: Investigate Unauthorized errors for task creation from external systems and plan external API access for Flow.
- Root cause: Existing app APIs require Flow session auth via chat_require_user(), so external portals/Postman calls without session return Unauthorized.
- Deliverables: Created docs/external_api/README.md, docs/external_api/ENDPOINT_CATALOG.md, and docs/external_api/TASK_API_DRAFT.md.
- Decision: Keep internal app APIs session-protected; add a versioned external API layer with bearer API keys, scopes, audit logs, rate limits, and stable endpoint paths.
- Build: Documentation-only change; no Flutter/PHP build required.

## 2026-07-24 11:28:40 +05:30 - Module Versioned External API Documentation
- Requirement: Define all Flow external APIs using module-first versioned paths such as chat/v1, users/v1, groups/v1, and channels/v1.
- Deliverables: Added VERSIONED_API_ROUTES.md, CHAT_V1.md, USERS_V1.md, GROUPS_V1.md, CHANNELS_V1.md, TASKS_REMINDERS_NOTIFICATIONS_V1.md, and FILES_ATTENDANCE_LOCATION_V1.md under docs/external_api.
- Change impact: Documentation-only; no runtime code changed. Existing session-protected app APIs remain unchanged.
- Decision: External platform APIs should use /router_login/api/{module}/v1/{resource}, bearer API keys, scopes, idempotency keys, rate limits, and audit logs.
- Build: Not required for documentation-only update.

## 2026-07-24 11:53:02 - Versioned External API Layer
- Added server_patch/api with /{module}/v1 endpoints and shared bootstrap dispatch.
- Modules: chat, users, groups, channels, tasks, reminders, notifications, files, attendance, location, releases, diagnostics.


## 2026-07-24 12:18:16 - Flow API v1 Expanded Modules
- Added modules: search/v1, saved/v1, ai/v1, external-users/v1, storage/v1, polls/v1, checklists/v1.
- Expanded chat/group/channel/files/location/attendance/releases handlers with action endpoints.
